#| Suppose you are given a table of currency exchange rates, represented as a 2D array.
#| Determine whether there is a possible arbitrage: that is, whether there is some sequence
#| of trades you can make, starting with some amount A of any currency, so that you can end
#| up with some amount greater than A of that currency.
#| There are no transaction costs and you can trade fractional quantities.
